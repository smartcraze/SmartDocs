title: Dynamic Max Heap Implementation
description: This code demonstrates the dynamic creation and manipulation of a Max Heap using C. A Max Heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes. The program includes functionality to build a heap, insert elements dynamically, and maintain the heap property. This documentation provides a step-by-step breakdown to help understand the core concepts of heap data structures and their implementation in C
---


## **Code Explanation**

### **Header Inclusion**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
```
The `stdio.h` library is included for basic input-output operations such as `scanf` and `printf`.

---

### **1. Swap Function**
```c
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
```
**Purpose:**  
A utility function to swap two integer values. It takes pointers to the two integers, swaps their values, and is commonly used to maintain the heap property.

---

### **2. Max Heapify Function**
```c
void maxHeapify(int arr[], int n, int i) {
    int largest = i;               // Assume the current node is the largest
    int left = 2 * i + 1;          // Left child index
    int right = 2 * i + 2;         // Right child index

    if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
        largest = left;

    if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
        largest = right;

    if (largest != i) {            // If the largest is not the current node
        swap(&arr[i], &arr[largest]);
        maxHeapify(arr, n, largest); // Recursively heapify the affected subtree
    }
}
```
**Purpose:**  
Ensures that the subtree rooted at index `i` satisfies the Max Heap property. It recursively fixes violations in the subtree.

---

### **3. Build Max Heap Function**
```c
void buildMaxHeap(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        maxHeapify(arr, n, i); // Heapify all non-leaf nodes
    }
}
```
**Purpose:**  
Converts an unsorted array into a Max Heap. It starts from the last non-leaf node (`n/2 - 1`) and calls `maxHeapify` for each node. This ensures the entire array satisfies the Max Heap property.

---

### **4. Insert Into Max Heap**
```c
void insertIntoMaxHeap(int arr[], int *n, int value) {
    (*n)++;                      // Increment the size of the heap
    int i = *n - 1;              // Index of the newly added element
    arr[i] = value;              // Place the new element at the end

    // Restore heap property by comparing the new element with its parent
    while (i > 0 && arr[(i - 1) / 2] < arr[i]) {
        swap(&arr[i], &arr[(i - 1) / 2]);
        i = (i - 1) / 2;         // Move up to the parent index
    }
}
```
**Purpose:**  
Dynamically inserts a new element into the heap and maintains the Max Heap property by swapping the new element with its parent until it is correctly positioned.

---

### **5. Main Function**
```c
int main() {
    int arr[100];                 // Array to store heap elements
    int n = 0;                    // Current size of the heap
    int num_elements;

    scanf("%d", &num_elements);   // Input the number of initial elements

    for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
        int value;
        scanf("%d", &value);
        insertIntoMaxHeap(arr, &n, value); // Insert each value into the heap
    }

    int new_element;
    scanf("%d", &new_element);    // Input the new element to insert

    buildMaxHeap(arr, n);         // Ensure the heap is valid
    insertIntoMaxHeap(arr, &n, new_element); // Insert the new element

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);    // Print the heap
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Flow**
1. **Input Handling:**
   - Read the number of initial elements.
   - Read each element and insert it dynamically into the Max Heap.

2. **Dynamic Insertions:**
   - A new element is inserted, and the heap property is restored.

3. **Heap Validation:**
   - After all insertions, `buildMaxHeap` ensures the heap property is maintained.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the heap array, which is organized in Max Heap order.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Insertions:** New elements are added to the heap while maintaining the Max Heap property.
- **Efficient Operations:** The program uses the **Heapify** technique for efficient heap creation and maintenance.
- **Scalability:** The heap is implemented using a fixed-size array of size `100`, but it can be adjusted for larger applications.

---

### **Example Input/Output**

**Input:**  
```
5
10 20 15 30 40
25
```

**Output:**  
```
40 30 25 10 20 15
```

**Explanation:**  
- Initial elements are inserted into the Max Heap: `[40, 30, 15, 10, 20]`.
- A new element `25` is added, and the heap is adjusted, resulting in `[40, 30, 25, 10, 20, 15]`.

### **Why Use a Max Heap?**
1. **Priority Queues:** Ideal for scenarios where the largest element must always be processed first.
2. **Sorting:** Forms the basis of **Heap Sort**, a popular sorting algorithm.
3. **Dynamic Management:** Efficiently manages dynamic datasets.
